# Cursor Workspace Rules

- Always read CONTEXT.md before suggesting code.
- Prefer the DB schema in prisma/schema.prisma as the source of truth.
- For survey data, prefer prisma/questions.csv and prisma/seed.ts.
- When modifying Prisma schema, use additive migrations first (no destructive changes).
- When adding required columns to existing tables, add as optional -> backfill -> make required.
- Never put secrets in frontend; all OpenAI calls stay in backend (server.js).
